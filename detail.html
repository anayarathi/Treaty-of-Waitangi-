        <div id="main"><h2>What is the Treaty of Waitangi?</h2>
        <p>Te Tiriti o Waitangi (the Treaty of Waitangi) was a written agreement made in 1840 between the British Crown (the monarch) and more than 500 Māori chiefs. After that, New Zealand became a colony of Britain and Māori became British subjects. However, Māori and Europeans had different understandings and expectations of te tiriti.</p><br>
            <h2>Drafting and signing</h2>
            <p>Te tiriti was drafted in English and then translated into Māori by missionary Henry Williams and his son Edward. It was presented to around 500 Māori at Waitangi on 5 February 1840 and there was much debate. The next day, 6 February, more than 40 chiefs signed te tiriti. Copies of te tiriti were taken around the country, and many more chiefs signed. Most Māori signed the te reo tiriti. Reasons why chiefs signed te tiriti included wanting controls on sales of Māori land to Europeans, and on European settlers. They also wanted to trade with Europeans, and believed the new relationship with Britain would stop fighting between tribes.Those who did not sign te tiriti were concerned they would lose their independence and power, and wanted to settle their own disputes. Some chiefs never had the opportunity to sign it, as it was not taken to all regions.</p><br><br>
            <h2>What did the Treaty say?</h2>
            <p>The meaning of the English treaty was not exactly the same as the meaning of the Māori tiriti.
<br>
Article One: in Māori it gave Queen Victoria governance over the land, while in English it gave her sovereignty over the land – a stronger term.
<br>
Article Two: Te tiriti guaranteed chiefs ‘te tino rangatiratanga’ – chieftainship over their lands, villages and treasured things. It also gave the Crown the right to deal with Māori in buying land. The English-language treaty gave chiefs ‘exclusive and undisturbed possession’ of lands, forests, fisheries and other property. It also gave the Crown an exclusive right to deal with Māori over buying land.
<br>
Article Three: both versions gave Māori the queen’s protection and the rights of British subjects.</p></div>
